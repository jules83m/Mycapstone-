    <h1>Racism</h1>
    <p>Racism is a huge problem in the United States, and it is no different when it comes to transportation. The United States has a long and troubling history of racism, and this has had a significant impact on the transportation system.</p>
    <p>Various black and brown communities around the United States have been paved through to make space for cars, and un uniaginable amount of culture has been lost</p>
    <p>In addition, many public transportation systems in the United States have been designed in a way that disproportionately benefits white communities. This has led to a lack of access to transportation for many black and brown communities, which can make it difficult for them to access jobs, education, and other opportunities.</p>
