        <h1>What transportation means to me</h1>
        <p>Transportation is the means of getting from one place to another, and can define and represent various parts of human nature and life.</p>
        <p>Throughout history, various forms of transportation have been invented by humans. From horses to the wheel to trains and trolleys and trams, humans have always found a way to make mobility easier.</p>
        <p>The United States ended World War Two as (basically) the sole victor. With all of their acquired wealth and prosperity, they began to invest in the future.</p>
        <p>In the 1950s, that was cars. They were comfortable, easy, and private. They also perfectly fit into the capitalist model of the US government, and investment started to roll in.</p>
        <p>Companies like General Motors and Michelin Tires lobbied aggressively, utilizing their newfound wealth and investment, and went around the United States tearing out trolleys and streetcars to make way for wide roads and single person vehicles.</p>
        <p>These decisions paved the way for a vehicle-focused future, and one where all other forms of transportation came behind cars.</p>
