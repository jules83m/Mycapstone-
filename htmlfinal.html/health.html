    <h1>Health</h1>
    <p>Cars promote unhealthy ways, allowing users to get anywhere they want with basically no activity.</p>
    <p>The Unites States has one of the largest obesity rates, and cars are a big reason. Things like drive thrus and big box stores further promote the unhealthy use of cars, leading to a never ending cycle of obesity. These jobs are alsominimum wage, keeping the workers oppressed also trapped in the car cycle</p>
    <p>In addition, cars can contribute to stress and anxiety. Traffic congestion, long commutes, and the pressure to find parking can all lead to increased stress levels for drivers. This can have a negative impact on mental health, and can contribute to a variety of health problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression.</p>
