    <h1>Pollution</h1>
    <p>Pollution is one of the biggest problems with cars. Cars emit a variety of pollutants, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants can have a significant impact on air quality, and can contribute to a variety of health problems, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer.</p>
    <p>In addition, cars are a major contributor to climate change. The burning of fossil fuels in cars releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is a major greenhouse gas. This contributes to global warming, which can have a variety of negative impacts on the environment, including rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and changes in ecosystems.</p>
    <p>Electric cars are just as worse, requiring lithium farming which is incredibly environmentally damaging.</p>
